(13/12/2017) Today I took apart the Original Xbox, it took quiet a long time as this is the first time I have done somrthing like this. 
You can see the pictures here: https://github.com/retro-programmer/Converting-Original-Xbox-Into-Case-For-RaspberrPi anyway I will 
probebly go our shopping this weekend to buys some USB ports and other stuff for the case. I will keep up with this Build diary until the 
end.
